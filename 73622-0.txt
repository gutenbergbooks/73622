GENTLEMEN,

I Humbly take the Liberty to address this Work to You, and presume
to hope, from Your exact Knowledge of the Subjects it contains, and
Your having been pleased to countenance the several Parts of it, as
they were published, with Your Acceptance and Approbation, that You
will not, now they are put together, deny them the Honour of Your
Patronage.

The Institution of Your Society for the Improvement of Natural
Knowledge, must render it not improper to lay before You every
Attempt towards such Improvement. On the contrary, You have a sort of
Right to expect, that every Author in Natural History, should submit
his Labours to Your Examination, and think himself happy if they will
stand the Test of Your Judgment.

The Animal and Vegetable Parts of the Creation afford endless Stores
for the Enquiry and Entertainment of the curious Naturalist: and
some of the most beautiful of each Sort, are here presented to the
Eye, in their true Size, Form, and Colour. Nor will it be objected
by You, that too much Time and Pains has been bestowed on a Company
of Insects, which few People trouble themselves about; for true
Philosophy teaches, that the meanest thing God has made, is not below
the Dignity of the most exalted of mortal Men to consider. But the
Creatures here exhibited, are adorned with such a Variety of Beauty
to engage our Notice, and undergo such amazing Changes in their Form
and Appearance, that a thinking Mind can hardly avoid regarding them
with uncommon Pleasure and a more than ordinary Attention.

Little, perhaps, is wanting to make the Study of Nature universally
pursued, than to render it easy and intelligible; for, surely, the
Understanding God has given us, can never be more properly employed,
than in examining and considering those Proofs of his Divine Goodness
and Power, which are placed every where around us. This is a most
reasonable and satisfactory Entertainment; and I am fully persuaded,
many of You, Gentlemen, have often experienced more real Pleasure
from such Examinations, than those who know nothing of them can
possibly conceive.

My Attempt towards a Natural History of the _English Moths_ and
_Butterflies_, (which is here added to the Paintings of them) wherein
they are divided into Classes, and their several Progressions and
Changes from the Egg to the Fly-state are described, (and that not
from Books or Conjectures, but from actual Experiments and close
Observation) will, I hope, meet with Your Approbation.

But not to be longer troublesome than to beg Pardon for this
Presumption, and with a continual increase of Prosperity and Honour
to the ROYAL SOCIETY of _London_, permit me to subscribe myself,

                                            GENTLEMEN,

                                                 _Your most obedient_,

                                                     _Humble Servant_,

                                                      BENJAMIN WILKES.

THE PREFACE.


_The Painting of HISTORY PIECES and PORTRAITS in Oyl being the
Profession of the Author of this Work, he frequently found himself
at a Loss, in the Course of his Employment, to understand with
Certainty what Colours would contrast with and set off each other
to the best Advantage; and perhaps had still remained under the
same Difficulties, had he not been led by Accident into the Means
of learning all this from Nature, which undoubtedly is the best
Instructor.

It happened that a Friend invited him one Evening, to bear him
Company to a Society named the AURELIAN: the agreeable Purpose of
which is, to become acquainted with that Part of Natural Philosophy
which relates to the Generation and Properties of Insects, of which
they have a fine Collection. And here he first saw such Specimens
of Nature’s admirable Skill in the Disposition, Arrangement,
and contrasting of Colours (particularly amongst the Moths and
Butterflies) as struck him with Amazement, and convinced him, at the
same Time, that studying them would turn greatly to his Advantage.

With this View he desired to become a Member of the AURELIAN
SOCIETY, and soon after had the Honour to be admitted; when, by his
own Diligence, together with the genenerous and kind Assistance
of some Gentlemen of the Society, it was not long before he had
acquired a tolerable Collection of English MOTHS and BUTTERFLIES;
and for ten Years past his leisure Hours have chiefly been employed
in the collecting and making Drawings of the different ~English
Caterpillars~, ~Aureliæ~ or ~Chrysalides~, ~Flies~, &c. that he could
any Ways obtain; and in making such Observations and Remarks thereon
as shall now, with all Submission, be laid before the Publick.

He has been greatly assisted in this Work by that well-known and
ingenious Naturalist, Mr. ~Joseph Dandridge~; to whose noble
Collection he had free Access during his Life-time, and also the
Liberty of making what Use he thought fit of his curious Remarks on
these Subjects, which were the Fruits of no less than forty Years
Experience. And he is still favoured in the like Manner by his
Successors, as often as he finds Occasion.

Respect to the Memory of this valuable and worthy Man, will not
suffer him to omit this Opportunity of giving him the Character
that is most justly his due, viz. That he was a Person of unbounded
Curiosity, and unwearied Application in his Researches into the Works
of Nature; in the Study of which all those Hours were employed that
could be spared from his immediate Business; by which Means, during a
long Life, he had not only got together a great Variety of the most
rare natural Productions, but also from Time to Time had written down
his Observations thereon, which deserve the highest Regard, as his
Judgment and Veracity were both without Exception. And, as he loved
these Studies himself, he was a zealous Encourager of all that had
the same Inclination, whom he was always ready to assist with his
laboriously acquired Knowledge.

But to proceed—He must also acknowledge, that in the Course of this
Undertaking he has made use of the Drawings of some Caterpillars and
Flies which were published not long ago in a curious Work of this
Sort, by ~J. A. Rosel~, at ~Norimburgh~, in ~Germany~: But he has
taken from him such only as are exactly of the same Species with
what we have in England, though we have not yet been so fortunate
to meet with them under all their several Changes: what Information
that Gentleman has given, as to those Particularities concerning them
which we are yet unacquainted with, he therefore judged proper to
insert.

As to the ~Plants~, ~Flowers~, and ~Fruits~, he declares himself
under the highest Obligation to a most curious Naturalist, and
worthy Member of the Royal Society of ~London~, whose costly and
valuable Collection is known to the learned World, and esteemed as
it deserves. This Gentleman has generously permitted him to make use
of many excellent Paintings of these Subjects, which were taken from
Nature by those two celebrated Artists Mr. ~George Dennis Ehret~,
and Mr. ~Jacobus Van Heysum~, and executed with the utmost Judgment
and Command of Pencil, so that he could hardly doubt but that true
Copies of them would give great Pleasure to the Lovers of Botany,
whom he has endeavoured to entertain with all the Variety he could
introduce.

Some Ill-natured People, that love to find Fault with every Thing,
have, he hears, objected against the Liberty he has taken, in giving
in several of his Plates, ~Plants~, ~Flowers~, and ~Fruits~, that
are not in Reality the Food of the ~Caterpillars~ therein exhibited;
but as the greatest Part of the ~Caterpillars~ described in this
Work feed chiefly on the ~Oak~, ~Elm~, ~Black-Thorn~, ~White-Thorn~,
~Willow~, and ~Nettle~, all which are separately represented in
different Plates, it was judged unnecessary (and would certainly
have been tiresom) to repeat those Subjects, as often as different
~Caterpillars~ are presented to which they serve for Food: and
therefore, instead of so doing, the Author has enriched his
Undertaking with some of the most beautiful Productions of Nature
in the Vegetable Kingdom: But, however, has not forgot to place the
~Caterpillars~, in most of the Plates, on a small Specimen of the
real Plant on which it feeds, as will be properly explained in the
Account of each Particular ~Fly~:—and this Care, it is hoped will be
an Answer to all unreasonable Cavils.

The ~Plates~ are all drawn and etched with his own Hand, in a quite
new Manner; whereby every Design, when coloured, appears like a
regular Piece of Painting; and the ~Flies~ are drawn and Painted with
the utmost Exactness, from as fine and perfect Specimens as can be
bred. The common Method of amusing the Reader with long Accounts of
the Colours and Markings of each ~Fly~ is avoided in this Work, as
entirely needless, when the Objects are truly represented before his
Eyes.

His Classing of the ~Caterpillars~ will be found of great Use; for
if it be enquired what ~Fly~ any ~Caterpillar~ that may happen to
present itself will produce, by observing its Character you will
easily be satisfied (if it is in this Collection) and be likewise
taught what its proper Food is, &c. ~Names~ are absolutely necessary
to distinguish one ~Fly~ from another, and enable the Curious in
this Study to communicate any Observations they may make; which,
without giving Names to the ~Flies~, would be very difficult, if
even possible to be done; as they must be greatly at a Loss to make
others perfectly understand what ~Flies~ they are treating of. The
worthy Members of the AURELIAN SOCIETY, and several other ingenious
Gentlemen, have been so sensible of this, that they, from Time to
Time, have thought proper to bestow some Name on every Species that
has come within their Knowledge._

_Indeed Names are arbitrary, and if remembered, and the Intent of
them well understood, may, whatever they are, serve the Purpose of
giving them: But here, as in every Thing else, a Propriety is to be
aimed at, and the Names given ought to denote some distinguishing
Particularity, and that the most obvious, in the Subject on which
they are bestowed, so as to make the Name, if possible, descriptive
of the Thing: Which Rule has been followed as strictly as might be in
naming the ~Moths~ and ~Butterflies~ contained in this Work: that is
to say, the Shape, the Colour, the Marking, the Food, or the Place
where found is what they are named from. But in doing this, where the
Author found them named to his Hands in this descriptive Manner, he
has gladly retained the Name they had already, and only presumes to
bestow Names himself on such as either had none at all, or which he
thought not sufficiently denotative of the particular Flies intended
to be known by them.

The Division of the Work into Books and Chapters may need some
Explanation, since under some of the Divisions very few, or even but
one single ~Fly~ is placed; the Reason whereof is, that the Plan
here laid down is intended for the Arranging of all the ~Moths~
and ~Butterflies~, whose Progression is known at present, or shall
hereafter be discovered in ~England~; of which, as the ~Flies~
here given are but a small Part, this must be considered but as an
Out-line to be filled up occasionally.

It is hoped the Directions here given how to collect the
~Caterpillars~ or ~Chrysalides~, how to feed and take Care of them,
how to preserve the ~Flies~ when bred, and where and at what Times
they may be found most easily, will prove both acceptable and useful
to every curious Collector; and as the Author thinks himself under
great Obligations to the Subscribers to, and Encouragers of this
Undertaking, a List of their Names is added as a Memorial of his
Gratitude.

These Things being premised, we come now to give a short Sketch of
the Natural History of the ~English Moths~ and ~Butterflies~ in
general._

INTRODUCTION.


Of MOTHS and BUTTERFLIES in general.

The Opinion of _Equivocal Generation_ however formerly received, has
by the present Age been deservedly rejected; since every Observation
proves, that all Creatures are produced by Parents of their own
Kind, and that in general those Parents are Male and Female; and
the Production of every _Moth_ and _Butterfly_ in this Manner, is I
believe at present not doubted by any Body.

The Females, both of the _Moth_ and _Butterfly_, lay their Eggs in
a short Time after Copulation, _upon_ or contiguous _to_ what will
supply proper Food for the young Brood when produced. After a certain
Period the Infant _Caterpillars_ included in the Eggs burst their
Shells, crawl forth, and feed upon the Provision ready prepared for
them. And each of these _Caterpillars_, having fed its appointed
Time, becomes a _Chrysalis_ or _Aurelia_; from which State, after a
while, it issues forth a _Fly_ in the Likeness of its Parent.

Some Species of _Butterflies_ breed twice a Year. Those that come
forth in _May_ lay their Eggs soon after, which Eggs in about
nine Days Time are hatched. The _Caterpillars_ feed for about six
Weeks, then change to _Chrysalis_, lie in that State for about
fourteen Days, and then the _Flies_ are bred. These lay their Eggs
as the first Brood did, the _Caterpillars_ change to _Chrysalis_ in
_September_, and the _Flies_ come forth in the following _May_.

The Variety of the _Moth_ Kinds is so great, that perhaps there is
scarce a Day in the Year when some of them are not bred. The Time
of their Continuance in the _Chrysalis_ State will be best known by
attending to the Account of each _Moth_ described in the following
Plates. Some _Moths_ as well as _Butterflies_ breed twice a Year.

It frequently happens, that the _Fly_ does not come out at the
usual Time, but continues in the _Chrysalis_ State till that Time
Twelvemonth; so that the Creature remains in that Case a Year and
nine Months (and sometimes longer) in a State of Rest, without
Nourishment of any kind.

Thus much in general:—We descend now to particular Observations.




On the different Manner of laying their Eggs.


All _Butterflies_ and _Moths_ lay a great Number of Eggs, some even
as far as two or three Hundred. The Eggs of some Kinds are glutenous,
or covered with a glewy Moisture; but those of others are not so:
The glutenous are fixt (sometimes singly) on _Grass_, _the Leaves
of Trees_, _Shrubs_, &c. and sometimes in Clusters after the same
Manner. Some Sorts of Eggs are laid naked or uncovered, and others
are cloath’d with a sort of Down, _&c._ Some _Flies_ lay them in a
Spiral Line, or Screw-like Figure, round a small Twigg, a Stalk of
Grass, _&c._ And these may be pulled off entire, in Fashion like a
Cylindrical Tube, and as hard as Horn: Others deposit theirs in the
Chinks of the _Barks of Trees_, &c. &c. &c.

It is observeable, that the whole Process from the Egg, to the _Fly_,
of many Species, is perform’d in about sixty Days. But the _Goat
Moth_ is an Exception to this Rule, being reported to be three Years
proceeding from the Egg to the _Fly_ State.


Of the Eggs.

The Eggs are of various Forms; some are round, some are oval, and
many of the _Moth-Kind_ flat, and perforated through the Middle; so
that the _Embrios_ or _Caterpillars_ lie curl’d up before they are
hatch’d, as they frequently do afterwards when come to Maturity. They
are found of all manner of Colours, and many of them are extremely
beautiful if view’d with a Microscope; some being curiously rib’d
and adorn’d with _Protuberances_, _&c._ like the nicest carved Work;
others marbled and spotted with an amazing Variety of delightful
colouring.


_Of_ CATERPILLARS.

Caterpillars are usually divided into the Naked and Cloathed Kinds.
Among the Cloath’d some have only small Tufts of Hair or Down, others
are cover’d all over with it.

The _Caterpillars_ of all known _Butterflies_ have six Hooks or Claws
before, eight Feet in the Middle of their Body, and two Holders
behind. Those that produce _Moths_ have all six Hooks or Claws
before, and Holders behind. Some have eight Feet in the Middle, some
four, and some only two next their Holders.

Some Species of _Caterpillars_ always feed inclos’d or spun up in the
Leaves they feed upon, others take their Food openly and in Sight.

Some are sociable and herd together whilst young, but when they
change their third Skin they grow unsociable and feed separately.

Others are born unsociable, and feed separately from their Infancy.

Some Species spin a large Web that will contain an hundred
_Caterpillars_, or more, from which they never go far till they have
eat up all the Leaves that are near thereto: Then they spin a new
Web, and so (shifting their Quarters) in a short Time, instead of
the green Leaves that they have devoured, leave the Tree, or Bush,
covered only with their white Webs.

Some Sorts, when disturbed, let themselves down by a Thread like a
Spider, by which Means they avoid being devoured by other Insects
that have not the Means of following them, _&c._


Of the Food of CATERPILLARS, and their Manner of Feeding.

Their Food is almost general, but some Kinds will eat nothing except
their own particular Trees, or Plants.

Some Species feed upon Herbage, others live and feed upon the solid
Parts of Trees, and Barks.

Some dwell in the Earth, or other private Recesses in the Day-time,
and at Night come forth, and feed on Grass, Flowers, _&c._ Others
again feed on the different Kinds of Mosses, Heath, Broom, the Leaves
of Trees, Shrubs, _&c._

Some feed upon the Waters naked and exposed, and others make
themselves Cases of Sticks, Rushes, _&c._ in the Waters, where they
get their Food.


Of the Forms of CATERPILLARS.

The Variety and Beauty which present themselves to our Eyes in the
Form and Colouring of _Caterpillars_, are no less remarkable than the
_Flies_ themselves, as the Reader will be satisfied by examining the
following Plates.


Of the Change of CATERPILLARS into the _Chrysalis_ State.

When a _Caterpillar_ has fed its appointed Time, and is come to full
Maturity, it undergoes a Change, and becomes a Body of a different
Form, incrusted with a Shell, and usually called a _Chrysalis_ or
_Aurelia_; the Shell of which is formed underneath the Skin of the
_Caterpillar_, which Skin comes off as soon as the _Aurelia_ becomes
perfect.


Of the CHRYSALIS or AURELIA.

During its Continuance in the _Chrysalis_ State, it seems to have
no Sense but Feeling; and some of them have even that in a very low
Degree, for they may be touched pretty roughly without moving.

The _Chrysalides_ or _Aureliæ_ of the _Butterfly-Kind_ are all very
beautiful; some of them look as if they were studded with Gold; some
are striped, others spotted, and others mottled with all the various
Colours of the Rainbow. But those of the _Moth-Kind_ are not so;
differing very little from one another, either in Shape or Colour,
except the Magpye, and some few besides.


How the _Aurelia_ or _Chrysalis_ is secured.

Nothing in Nature is perhaps more deserving Notice, than the
many different Methods whereby _Caterpillars_ conceal and secure
themselves whilst in this helpless and unactive Condition.

Some of them spin a large Case of Silk in Form of an Egg, wherein the
_Chrysalis_ lies concealed, till the Time comes for the _Fly_ to make
its Appearance, which it does by piercing through this Case.

Of such Cases there are several Sorts, different in Form and Colour:

Some are long, and drawn out to a Point at each End; others are more
round.

The Texture of some is very thick and close.

Others are thin, like Gause, insomuch that the _Chrysalis_ may be
seen thorough them.

Some _Aureliæ_ are white, some yellow, and others of different Hues;
and most of the hairy _Caterpillars_ intermix their Hair amongst the
Spinning.

Some _Caterpillars_ form a hard-crusted Case, composed of silk
Threads glewed together, in such Manner as to become hard like an
Egg-shell, so that when the _Fly_ comes out, a round Hole like a Door
appears.

The Silk-spinning _Caterpillars_ are of various Kinds, and deposit
their _Aureliæ_ in different Places, and in different Manners, _viz._
some fasten them on the Leaves and Stalks of Plants, without any
Covering; others spin the Leaves over them; others lodge them in
Holes and Crevices; and others in the Earth.

Many of the _Moth-Kind_ place their _Chrysalis_ in the Earth, about
an Inch or two deep, surrounding it with a Case of Earth lined with
a glutenous Matter, that no Wet can penetrate: And what is very
surprizing, notwithstanding the extreme Delicacy and Tenderness of
the _Fly_ when first bred, be the Ground never so hard, it makes its
way thorough it without ruffling a single Feather.

Few, if any, of the _Butterfly-Kind_ form a Case or Spinning,
except what fastens the Tail and Body of the _Chrysalis_. Some hang
perpendicularly downwards, and others in an horizontal Position,
being fastened by the Tail, with a Thread round the Back and on each
Side. Some are secured within the Leaves spun together; others are
hid in the Hollows and Barks of Trees; and others again under the
Copings of Walls, in Houses, Sheds, _&c._


Of the FLY.

After the _Chrysalis_ has remained its due Time, the _Fly_ bursts the
Shell wherein it was contained, and comes out formed perfectly in
every Part, except the Wings, which then appear too small to cover
its Body. In this naked Condition it crawls up to some convenient
Place, where its Wings may hang down without any Hindrance: And when
thus disposed, the Wings begin to expand themselves so much, that in
the Space of half an Hour, the Wings (of _Butterflies_) are stretched
commonly to their full Size; nay, even those of the largest _Moths_
seldom require above an Hour’s Time. At first they are flabby, like
wet Paper, but soon afterwards they become stiff, and capable of
supporting them in their Airy Flights, _&c._

In this _Fly_ State their first Care seems to be the Propagation of
their Species, for some of them will copulate immediately if they can
find a Mate; to seek which the Male _Butterfly_ takes Wing, as soon
as his Wings are in a proper Condition: But few _Moths_, whether bred
in the Night Time or in the Day, ever offer to fly till the Night
after their Birth, when they go in Search of the Females.

The Females (especially of the _Moth_ Kinds) seldom, if ever, take
Wing till they have been cocked: they often continue in Conjunction
twelve Hours and more, after which the Female lays her Eggs, flies
about for a Time, and then dies.—The Females of some Kinds are
without Wings.

The Males (of some Species) have a surprizing Quickness and
Distinction in their Sense of Smelling, exceeding that of the
Blood-Hound, or any other Creature yet known; for if a Female be
concealed in a Box, and there are any Males within half a Mile or
more, they will fly directly to the Place, and hover round it. By
this Means a Dozen Male _Egger-Moths_ have been taken in an Hour’s
Time, and that at about Twelve o’Clock at Noon, as may be seen in the
Account of the _Egger-Moth_.

Their Continuance in the _Fly_ State depends greatly on the Weather,
many _Flies_ being destroyed as soon as bred, by Storms of Hail,
_&c._ but if the Season proves favourable, many will live for a
Fortnight, three Weeks, or longer, and some even all the Winter
through.


The Distinction of MOTHS and BUTTERFLIES.

MOTHS and BUTTERFLIES agree in their Progression from the _Egg_ to
the _Fly_ State, are different when in that State, in the following
Particulars.

BUTTERFLIES have a Ball or Knob at the Extremity of each of their
_Antennæ_, or _Horns_.

The Horns of MOTHS have not such Balls or Knobs, but are constantly
threaded or pointed: except the Males of some Species, whose Horns
are ramified, or in the Form of Combs.

All BUTTERFLIES settle with their Wings erect, and generally keep
them in that Posture, unless when basking in the Sun.

Most MOTHS do not settle with their Wings erect, but place them
horizontally, or inclining to their Feet.

All BUTTERFLIES come abroad by Day-Light, and chiefly when the Sun
shines bright.

MOTHS fly, some by Day-Light, some by Twilight, and some in the Dead
of Night.

_N. B._ There is a Species of _Fly_ betwixt the _Moth_ and the
_Butterfly_, whose Horns are more flat and hollow; this is describ’d
in the second Book of this Work, by the Name of the _Burnet_.


Concerning the Food of the FLY.

The Food of these Creatures in the _Fly_ State, is very different
from what it was when they were _Caterpillars_: _Butterflies_ feed
on all Kinds of Flowers, and on several sorts of Fruits, and I have
seen them extremely fond of the Juices that issue from the Bodies of
several Sorts of Trees.

_MOTHS_ feed on the same Things, as also on the Honey-Dew that is
found on the Leaves of Limes, Elms, _&c._ The _Moths_, as well as the
_Butterflies_, are furnished with a long Proboscis, or Tongue, which
lies curl’d up like a Watch-Spring, under the fore Part of the Head.
The Length of this Proboscis varies according to the Species of the
_Fly_, and is from half an Inch, to four Inches long.


The Enemies of _Moths_ and _Butterflies_.

Nature has been so abundant in the Production of these Creatures,
that were it not for the many Dangers they are exposed to, through
every Stage of their Lives, the whole World would be too small
to contain their Offspring, in four or five Years; for, upon
Calculation, the Progeny of one Pair of large _Butterflies_,
(supposing them to lay only 100 Eggs, whereas many of them lay 2 or
300, and that twice a Year) would be sufficient to cover the whole
Kingdom of _England_ in about twelve Years.

While in the Egg, they are devoured in great Numbers by Birds and
other Animals.

Whilst _Caterpillars_, they are a Prey to small Birds of all Kinds,
being almost the only Food wherewith such Birds nourish and rear
their young ones.

_CATERPILLARS_ likewise kill and devour one another; and, besides
that, Numbers of them die in shifting their Skins, and in changing
into the _Chrysalis_ State. But the greatest Enemy they have in this
State, is the _Ichneumon Fly_.

In the _Aurelia_ State, such as have no Case are a Prey to Birds,
_&c._ those in the Earth, to Moles, Mice, and other subterraneous
Animals; and besides, great Numbers are destroyed by Frosts and Wet.
In the _Fly_ State they are a Prey to Birds, Batts, and many other
Creatures.

There are four different Ways, in one or other of which all Animals
of the _Moth_ or _Butterfly-Kind_ subsist during the Winter Season,
_viz._

  1. Some in the Egg State.
  2. Some in the _Caterpillar_ State.
  3. Some in the _Chrysalis_ State.
  4. And some in the _Fly_ State.

It is likewise to be observed, that the several Species of them chuse
different Places for their Residence

  1. Some frequent Woods.
  2. Some Plains and Heaths.
  3. Some Hedges and Thickets.
  4. Some Meads, and Mowing Grass.
  5. And others marshy wet Grounds, _&c._

  Several Kinds of _Caterpillars_ come forth of the Egg in _July_,
  _August_, _September_, and _October_, remain in the _Caterpillar_
  State all the Winter, feed up in the Spring, then change into the
   _Chrysalis_ State, and produce _Flies_ a few Weeks afterwards.

 Others there are that continue in the Egg State all the Winter, are
  hatched in the Spring, and feed up in about 45 Days: then change
  into the _Chrysalis_, and produce their _Flies_ in about 14 Days
                             afterwards.

 _N. B._ The Curious may be assured, that all these Observations are
  founded on real Facts, and not on any Supposition or Conjecture.

  And now, (as it seems exactly suitable to this Work) we shall beg
   Leave to close the Introduction with a short Description of the
         _Butterfly_, taken from a Poem called The UNIVERSE,
                   which was written some Years ago
                        By Mr. _Henry Baker_.

        _SEE, to the Sun the ~Butterfly~ displays
      Its glittering Wings, and wantons in his Rays:
      In Life exulting, o’er the Meadows flies,
      Sips from each Flow’r, and breathes the vernal Skies.
        Its splendid Plumes, in grateful Order, show
      The various Glories of the painted Bow.
      Where Love directs, a Libertine it roves,
      And courts the fair ones thro’ the verdant Groves.
        How glorious now! How chang’d since Yesterday! }
      When on the Ground, a crawling Worm it lay,      }
      Where ev’ry Foot might tread its Soul away!      }
      Who rais’d it thence? And bid it range the Skies?
      Gave its rich Plumage, and its brilliant Dyes?
        ’Twas ~God~:—Its ~God~ and thine, O ~Man~, and ~He~   }
      In this thy Fellow-Creature lets thee see,       }
      The wond’rous Change which is ordain’d for thee. }
      Thou too shalt leave thy reptile Form behind,           }
      And mount the Skies, a pure ethereal Mind,              }
      There range among the Stars, all bright and unconfin’d. }_

         An _Account_ of those _Places_ where some GENTLEMEN
                               OF THE
                          AURELIAN SOCIETY

Have been used to collect _Caterpillars_, _Chrysalides_ and _Flies_,

                In the following Months of the Year.


                               MARCH.

From the 15th to the 25th of this Month, a _Moth_ called the _Orange
Under-Wing_, may be taken in _Hornsey-Wood_, and in the Fields close
to the Sides thereof. It flies in the Day-time, is an exceeding
pretty _Moth_, and not to be met with in such Plenty any where else,
that I know of. The _Oak-Beauty_, and some other _Moths_ are bred in
this Month, but are rarely met with in the _Fly_ State.


                               APRIL.

In this Month a great Variety of _Caterpillars_ and _Chrysalides_
may be taken by the Method already described. The Banks about the
_Chelsea_ Water-Works and such-like Places are most likely to
furnish the _Chrysalides_ of the _Hawk Tribe_.

At the Roots of the _Elm_, _Lime_, _Willow_, and _Poplar Trees_, you
will find in this _Month_ a Variety of _Aureliæ_, which will produce
their _Flies_ in the _May_ and _June_ following.

Be now diligent to collect _Caterpillars_ from all kinds of Growths,
which, if taken Care of, will produce their _Flies_ a few Months
hence. Towards the End of this Month some _Flies_ may be taken in the
Day-time, and some _Moths_ in the Evening.


                                MAY.

This delightful Month brings forth in the Woods and Meads a
surprising Variety of _Flies_. _Hornsey_, _Cain_, and _Tottenham_
Woods; the Woods near _Southgate_; _Hanging_ Wood, by _Charlton_,
in _Kent_; _Oak of Honour_ Wood, by _Dulwich_; _Comb_ Wood, by
_Kingstone_, in _Surrey_, and the Fields adjacent are all frequented
by them in this Month in the Day-time as well as in the Evening; and
if the Weather be fine you will never fail of Sport. Abundance of
different _Caterpillars_ are likewise to be found at this Time, such
as those of the _Emperor-Moth_, of the _Lappit_, _Drinker_, _Egger_,
and of Numbers of other Sorts.


                                JUNE.

This Month adds greatly to the Number of _Flies_ bred in _May_.—From
the 20th to the 30th are usually produced: in _Southgate_, _Comb_,
and _Oak of Honour_ Woods, the _Great Fritillary_ and other fine
_Butterflies_, with Plenty of _Moths_; all which may be taken in and
near the Woods already mentioned.


                                JULY.

The first ten Days in this Month are the Time for taking the _Purple
Emperor-Butterfly_ in _Comb_ Wood; and the Fields adjacent can
furnish such a charming Variety of _Moths_ and _Butterflies_, that
I do not know any Place where an _Aurelian_ can spend a Week with
more Satisfaction and Assurance of Success. As soon as the _Purple
Emperor-Butterfly_ begins to grow bad, the Time comes on when the
second Breed of the _Swallow-tail Butterfly_ is quite fresh, as
also the _Great Tortoise-shell_, _Peacock Butterfly_, &c. About
the Middle of this Month you may find the _Great Red Underwing_
and the _Goat-Moth_ standing against the _Willow-Trees_ which
usually grow by the Sides of Ditches about the old Barge-House,
_Rotherhith_, _Vauxhall_, and likewise in other Places. Seek also for
the _Caterpillars_ that produce the _Great Elephant_ and _Gold-Spot
Moths_: the most certain Places to find which, that I know of, are by
the Sides of the Ditches in _Rotherhith_ Marshes. The _Caterpillars_
that produce the _Elephant Moth_ feeds on the _White Ladies
Bedstraw_, those of the _Gold-Spot_ on the _Great Water-Grass_. I
have taken the _Gold-Spot Chrysalis_ and _Caterpillar_ likewise in
the low Grounds by _Vauxhall_ in _Surry_.


                               AUGUST.

At the Beginning of this Month may be found amongst the _Willows_,
about the Banks by the _Chelsea_ Water-Works, the _Caterpillars_
that produce the _Eyed-Willow_ and _Poplar-Hawks_, also the
_Buff-Tip-Puss_, &c. and from the 20th to the 30th the _Admirable
Butterfly_, &c.


                             SEPTEMBER.

If this Month proves fine, a great many scarce _Moths_ are to be
taken in the Evenings, and the second Brood of the _Comma-Butterfly_,
as well as some other _Flies_, present themselves. _Caterpillars_
are likewise to be got in Plenty off the _Oak_, _Black-Thorn_, and
a Variety of other Foods; and these, if taken Care of, will produce
scarce and valuable _Flies_ in the succeeding

     Spring. From the End of this Month to the Middle of _March_
      there are but few _Flies_ that frequent the Fields; altho’
                I am of Opinion that some _Moths_ are
                        bred in every Month of
                              the Year.

[Illustration: (Decorative Design)]




         In order to oblige such persons as may be desirous

                       To make a COLLECTION of

                       MOTHS and BUTTERFLIES,

              Though unacquainted with the Manner how,

            It is judged proper to lay down the following

                             DIRECTIONS.


Provide yourself with a Net made of Muschetto Gause, and in Shape
like a Bat-fowling Net; let its Length be one Ell, the Width at
Bottom three Quarters of a Yard, at Top half a Yard, and cut
circular; this must be sewed to a Tape or Ferret, that it may be
fastened to a couple of Hasle or other Sticks five Feet long each,
the upper Part whereof should be bent circular to fit your Net.

You must likewise have a Stick of Hasle, or any other Wood, about
five or six Feet in Length, wherewith to put the _Flies_ and _Moths_
on the Wing, by beating the Boughs, Hedges, Shrubs, or other Growths
you are near, so that you may be better able to see and take them.

Furnish yourself likewise with Boxes of such Sizes as will go into
your Pocket, let them be lined at the Top and Bottom with Cork; be
also provided with a Pin-cushion, well stock’d with different Sorts
of Pins.

These Things being in readiness, go into the Woods and Fields thereto
adjacent (always placing yourself where the Sun has most Power, and
the Wind the least) also into Chalk-pits, rough Grounds, Lanes, _&c._
In all which Places, if it is a fine Day, and a proper Season of the
Year, you’ll find Plenty of Sport.

When you have taken a _Fly_ in your Net, lay the Net flat on the
Ground, which will prevent the _Fly_ from fluttering, then put the
Fore Finger of your Left Hand under the _Fly_, and with the same
Finger of your Right Hand give it a squeeze on the Back or Chest, and
that will kill it; be careful, however, not to press too hard, least
you damage the _Fly_. This done take a Pin and run it through the
Body, betwixt the Wings, letting that Side be uppermost which is most
beautiful; then stick it in your Box, and look for more Sport.

Having collected such a Number of _Flies_ as you think proper, and
being returned home, look into your Boxes, and observe which of them
are fit to set: such as you find dead and not stiff are so.

Then (having prepared before-hand two or three Boards covered with
Cork, of about ten Inches by sixteen in Size, or as you find most
convenient to place your _Flies_ in order on and extend their Wings
in the best manner: by the Assistance of little Braces made by
cutting a Card into Lengths or Slips, with a small Pin thrust through
the End of each) proceed to manage them as follows:

Take a _Fly_ out of your Box: see if the Pin be run through it
perpendicularly: if so, stick it on one of your setting Boards, and
with the Point of a Needle (which must be fixt into a small Stick,
or what else you like best) extend one Wing leisurely, till such
Time as the Point thereof is even with the Nose of the _Fly_ you are
setting. That done, fix one of your Card Braces gently on that Wing,
to prevent its giving way; serve the other Wing in the same manner,
and your _Fly_ will appear extended as in the Paintings. Let the
Braces remain on the Wings of _Butterflies_ a Fortnight, on those
of great _Moths_ a Month. Take Notice, however, that a great Number
of small _Moths_ must be set in your Boxes in the Field, otherwise
your labour will be lost; you’ll presently know which these are, by
observing them to be dead and almost stiff; so that it is proper to
carry always about you a little Box of Card Braces for this Purpose.

_The Way to preserve your ~Flies~, after you have taken them from
your Setting Board._

If you put them in Drawers, Boxes, or Frames with Glasses before
them, its proper to get some Camphire, which inclose in small Muslin
Bags, and fasten it to those Places where your _Flies_ are; by this
Means you will destroy those Insects that would otherwise injure your
_Flies_; and by renewing now and then this Method, I am convinced
your _Flies_ may be preserved several Years. The Months in _England_
that produce the greatest Variety of _Flies_, are _April_, _May_,
_June_, _July_, and _August_, especially of the _Butterfly_ Kind; and
for _Moths_, I am of Opinion, that there are many different Species
produced all the Year round. The best Time to take the greatest
Variety of _Moths_, is for one Hour after Sun-set, and the properest
Places are in and by the Sides of Woods, Gardens, Green Lanes, _&c._
where with your Net you’l seldom fail of Sport. Thus much seemed
necessary to say in Respect to taking _Insects_ in the _Fly_ State,
and more would be superfluous.

_But as it may be agreeable to some to breed the ~Flies~ themselves
from the ~Caterpillars~, I shall likewise give the best Instructions
I am able for that Purpose._

In the Spring and Autumn Season you may collect great Variety of
_Caterpillars_, by spreading a Sheet under _Oak-Trees_: then beating
the Boughs, many _Caterpillars_ will fall, which if taken Care of,
will produce scarce and valuable _Moths_; you may also obtain by the
same Means _Caterpillars_ from the _Black-Thorn_, _White-Thorn_,
_Bramble_, _Chickweed_, _Willow_, and many other Growths.

When you have collected a Number of _Caterpillars_, and remark’d
the Food you found them on, put them into Boxes, which prepare as
follows: Take a Deal or Wainscot Box, cut a large Square out of
the Top and Bottom, cover the Place cut out with a Piece of Crape
Hatband, glewing the same all round to prevent any Escape. This done,
put your _Caterpillars_ into the Box, with some of the same Food you
found them on, giving them, if you can, fresh every Day. Here you’ll
find them feed and thrive; and after changing their Skins (some five
and some six Times) they will go into the _Aurelia_ State, and there
remain for a certain Time, some much longer than others; but in about
fourteen Days from this last change you may look into your Boxes,
to see if you have any _Flies_ bred; remembring that out of such as
are produced in this manner, much more perfect _Flies_ may be chosen,
than any that can be caught; and as several Sorts of _Caterpillars_
go down into the Earth, and there change to _Chrysalis_, some Earth
must be put into the Boxes for that Purpose, at least two or three
Inches deep. Never take the _Chrysalides_ out of the Earth, nor
disturb them till the _Flies_ are bred.

There is yet another Thing proper to be known, in order to compleat
your Collection. A great Number of _Caterpillars_ go into the Earth,
and there change to _Aureliæ_, whose _Moths_ are seldom upon the
Wing till Night; these _Aureliæ_ are to be got by digging with such
a Trowel as the _Bricklayers_ use, about the Roots of Trees, such
as _Oaks_, _Elms_, _Limes_, _Poplars_, _Willows_, &c. also by the
Sides of Walls and Pales. The usual Time to dig for them is from
_September_ to _March_.

When you have obtain’d a Number of _Aureliæ_ by digging, you must
provide for them thus: Get some Earth and scowering Sand, mix them
well together, and put the Mixture into some large Garden Pots; lay
your _Aureliæ_ thereon, covering them with Moss; then sew a Piece of
Crape Hatband round a small Hoop, and put such a Cover on each Pot,
in order to receive the _Flies_ when bred, which will usually be in
the Months of _March_, _April_, _May_, and _June_. I have always kept
my Pots of _Aureliæ_ out in the open Air, and the _Flies_ have been
produced with great Success; however it may be proper to place a
Piece of Board over each Pot, to prevent unforeseen Accidents.

  Those who think proper to put these Directions in Practice, will,
 I am convinced, in a short Time, be possessed of a great Number of
      valuable _Flies_. What Food the _Caterpillars_ mentioned
          in this Work chuse to feed on, the Time when they
          change into _Aureliæ_, and when they issue forth
                   in the _Fly_ State, may be seen
                        in the Description of
                             each Plate.

                               PART I.

  _The_ CATERPILLARS, _described in this Book, are such as produce
 Moths; of which, as there is a great Variety, ’twas thought proper
        to range them under the following Heads or Chapters._




                              CHAP. I.


The CATERPILLARS belonging to this Chapter have six Hooks or Claws
before, eight Feet in the middle, and some have, and some have not
two Holders behind. Their Bodies are composed of twelve circular
Joints, or Rings, conjoined by a common Membrane, which they are
capable of contracting or expanding. When they would move along,
they dilate the muscular Skin that separates the first Ring from the
next; they advance the first Ring to a certain Distance, and then, by
contracting and expanding the Skin of that Part, they move the second
Ring: the same Method moves the Third, and so the whole Body marches
in Succession: the Motion of their Feet and Claws corresponding with
and assisting the progressive Motion of the Rings. _Vide Spectacle de
la Nature, Dial._ I.

The CATERPILLARS under this Head may likewise be divided into three
Classes:

  I. NAKED or without HAIR.

  II. Having little HAIR.

  III. Having much HAIR.

_The First_ CLASS, _or the_ NAKED _and without_ HAIR, _may be
subdivided in the following Manner_.


                              CLASS I.

           _Such_ CATERPILLARS _whose Bodies are_ SMOOTH.

The Great Yellow-underwing Moth. The CATERPILLAR of this MOTH lives
through the Winter, and comes to its full Growth in _May_: It is
found in Gardens, and other Places, and usually feeds in the Night,
as many other of the NAKED CATERPILLARS do. Indeed, were they to
do otherwise, they would soon be devoured by the Birds, which are
much fonder of these SMOOTH CATERPILLARS than of the HAIRY ones. In
the Day, they hide themselves within the Earth, and in other secret
Recesses. They feed on the Leaves of the _Stock-July_ and other
Flowers, as also on Grass, &c. They put on the _Chrysalis_ Form,
within the Earth, in _May_, and the _Moths_ are bred in _June_. Great
Plenty of this _Moth_, and other Species of the YELLOW-UNDERWING,
were taken feeding on the Honey Dew, on the Limes and other Trees,
in the Gardens of _John Philips_, Esq; at _Layton_ in _Essex_; they
were discovered, by the Help of a Candle and Lanthorn, from Twelve
o’Clock at Night till Two in the Morning; and were so fearless, that
they would suffer one to take them with the Hand. At the same Time
the ANGLE-SHADE and several other _Moths_ were taken.

The WILD ARRACH MOTH, Mr. _Rosel_ says, The _Caterpillar_ feeds on
the WILD ARRACH; that it changes to a _Chrysalis_, within the Earth,
in _September_, and that the _Moth_ appears at the End of _May_
following. I once took some of these _Caterpillars_ feeding on the
_Arrach_ in _September_, but had not the good Fortune to breed any
Flies from them. See _Rosel_, Cl. 2. Tab. 32.

The ANGLE-SHADES, a _Moth_. It is advisable to look for the
_Caterpillar_ of this Fly on Nettles, altho’ some feed on Fruit
Trees, Bramble Bushes, _&c_. It goes into the _Chrysalis_ State at
the End of _June_, in a Web mixed with Earth, which it forms upon
the Ground; and thus it remains till the Beginning of _September_,
when the _Moth_ is produced. There is an early Breed of this _Moth_
in _May_, but, as I have not had the _Caterpillar_ in the Spring, I
cannot relate its Progression. The Fly may be taken in the Evenings,
in Gardens, feeding on the Flowers; but I have not met with them very
frequent.

The PEASE-BLOSSOM, a _Moth_. Its _Caterpillars_ are reported by
_Merian_, and _Rosel_, to feed upon the wild Lark-Spur that grows
amongst Corn. They are full fed at the Beginning of _August_, when
they change to the _Chrysalis_, but appear not in the _Moth_ State
till the _June_ following. This Fly has been bred in _England_ by the
Honourable Mrs. _Walters_, and by _Nathaniel Oldham_, Esq; but, at
present, is very rare.

The SMALL GREEN OAK MOTH. The _Caterpillar_ feeds on the Oak, and
sometimes such Numbers of them are produced at the Beginning of
_May_, that they, in a Manner, strip the Oak-trees of their Leaves.
They are enabled, by the Help of a Spining, which they fasten after
the Manner of the Spider, to let themselves down from one Bough
to another, and from thence to the Ground, if they have a mind.
They change into the _Chrysalis_ State in a curled Form within the
Oak-leaves, (which they wrap over them, and fasten together by their
Web) and, after remaining so for about fourteen Days, the Fly is
bred. If you beat the Branches of the Oak-trees you may take Plenty
of this _Moth_ in the Day-time.

The SMALL ERMINE MOTH. The _Caterpillar_ that produces this _Moth_
is as common as those just mentioned. I have seen a Hedge-row of
White-thorn, at the End of _May_ and at the Beginning of _June_, the
Leaves of which have been eaten almost up by these _Caterpillars_.
They feed also on Black-thorn, Fruit-trees, _&c._ when they are
preparing to change to _Chrysalis_, they get together in Numbers, and
spin a large transparent Web, within which they fasten themselves by
the Tail, and undergo their Change. They remain in this Condition for
about three Weeks: The _Moths_ come forth in _June_ and _July_, and
are very common about most Hedges.

The BROOM-MOTH. The Food of this _Caterpillar_ is the Leaves of
Broom, on which I found Plenty of them, from the 20th to the 30th
of _September_, near _Shooter’s Hill_ in _Kent_; they were of the
Bigness express’d in the Plate. The Green ones produced male Flies.
They all went into the Earth at the Beginning of _October_, and, at
the Beginning of _May_ following, the _Moths_ were bred. I never
could take any of them in the Fly-state.

The SALLOW MOTH. The _Caterpillar_ was fed by Mr. _Dandridge_ on the
common Sallow, until it changed to a _Chrysalis_ within the Earth,
which was at the Beginning of _June_. The _Moth_ was produced about
the Middle of _September_. These _Moths_ are not common; for, in
all my Practice, I have not been able to take above three or four,
and that was in the Evening, near _Shooter’s Hill_, in the Month of
_September_. The _Caterpillars_ are likewise very scarce.

The CODLING MOTH. Mr. _Rosel_ says, The _Caterpillar_ of this _Moth_
feeds on the Kernels of Apples and Pears. The _Moth_ lays her Eggs at
the End of _June_: Eight Days after the _Caterpillars_ are bred; and,
when full fed, they go out of the Fruit and change to the _Chrysalis_
under the Bark of the Tree. They remain there all the Winter, and the
_Moths_ are bred in _June_ following. I have, myself, found Plenty
of these Flies sticking on the Bark of the Oak-trees, in _Richmond_
Park, at the End of _June_, in the Day-time.

The PROVENCE ROSE MOTH. Rose Leaves are the Food of this
_Caterpillar_. In the Middle of _May_ I had some of them that changed
to the _Chrysalis_ folded in the Leaves; at the Beginning of _June_
the _Moths_ were bred. They may be taken in Gardens in the Evening.

The SCOLLOP-WINGED OAK MOTH. I took the _Caterpillar_ of this
_Moth_, feeding on Oak-leaves, about the 10th of _June_, at which
Time it went into the _Chrysalis_, spining itself up in a Leaf;
and the _Moth_ was bred on the 7th Day of _July_. Both _Moth_ and
_Caterpillar_ are very scarce.

The BLACK-THORN MOTH, or, _Figure of_ 8. The _Caterpillar_ is easily
found, feeding on Black Thorn, White Thorn, Crab-tree, _&c._ towards
the End of _May_, at which Time it spins a hard Case against its
Food, and changes to a _Chrysalis_; the _Moth_ is bred about the End
of _August_, and is not commonly taken.

The GREEN MOTH with SILVER LINES. I fed its _Caterpillar_ with
Oak-leaves, on which it had been found. It work’d itself up in a dark
brown Case on the Back-side of one of the Leaves, and changed into a
_Chrysalis_ the 27th of _September_; the _Moth_ appeared the 20th of
_May_ following, and is difficult to meet with.

The RANUNCULUS MOTH. The _Caterpillars_ represented in this Plate
were found feeding on the _Ranunculus_ Flower about the Middle of
_June_, at which Time they were full fed, and soon changed to the
_Chrysalis_ within a Spining or Web; and the _Moths_ came out at the
Beginning of _September_. The _Caterpillar_ and _Moth_ are both very
rare.

The WATER-BETONY MOTH. The _Caterpillars_ are sociable, and feed
together. They may be found, towards the End of _May_, full fed, on
the _Water-Betony_; as also on the _Mullein_, which is their proper
Food. They go into the Earth about that Time, and change to the
_Chrysalis_, within a Case composed of Earth and a webby Matter,
which they spin together. The _Moth_ appears in _March_ following;
but it is not commonly taken in its Fly-state.

The SMALL ELEPHANT MOTH. Mr. _Rosel_ informs us, That the
_Caterpillar_ is to be found on the Grass in Meadows, in the Month of
_August_; but whether that be its favourite Food he does not know. It
makes a Spining, and changes to a _Chrysalis_ towards the End of that
Month. The _Moth_ is bred about the End of _May_.

In the Year 1743, on the 28th of _May_, I took several of these
_Moths_, in the Evening (after Sun-set) as they were hovering about,
and feeding on a Flower called _The Batchelors Button_, by the Side
of _Osterly Wood_, near _Brentford_. They are very swift in flight,
and therefore must be taken as soon as they approach the Flower.
The Females layed their Eggs freely, and, after seven Days, the
_Caterpillars_ were hatch’d, to the Number of about 300. I took the
utmost Pains to raise them; but, for want of their proper Food, they
all died.

The GOLD-SPOT MOTH. The _Caterpillar_, whence this _Moth_ is
produced, may be found about the End of _July_, full fed, in the
Marshes about _Rotherhith_, _Vauxhall_, and such like Places.
It feeds on the Leaves of the great Water-grass, _&c._ but the
_Caterpillar_ is not so easily found as the Spining which it makes to
contain its _Chrysalis_; for that spining, being of a whitish Colour,
may be seen at a good Distance, in Shape and Manner as described in
the Plate. It lies in the _Chrysalis_ State about three Weeks, and
the _Moth_ is bred from the Middle to the End of _August_; but it is
seldom taken in the Fly-state.

The SWORD-GRASS MOTH. Mr. _Rosel_ informs us, That the _Caterpillar_
of this Fly feeds on the _Orache_; that, in _June_, it changed to
a _Chrysalis_ within the Earth, in which State it remained three
Weeks, and then the _Moth_ was bred. I once took one of these
_Caterpillars_, full grown, feeding on the _Sword-grass_ in the
Marshes at _Rotherhith_; but that was in the Month of _August_,
and the _Moth_ was bred with me at the End of _September_. Both
_Caterpillar_ and _Moth_ are very scarce.

The JESSAMINE-HAWK MOTH. This _Moth_ was bred in _England_ by Mr.
_Dandridge_, who took the _Caterpillar_, at _Hampton-Court_, full
fed, on the _Jessamine_, about the Middle of _July_; at which Time it
went into the Ground, and changed to a _Chrysalis_, and the _Moth_
came forth at the End of _October_. This Gentleman had also five or
six _Caterpillars_, of the same Kind, brought to him, that were taken
upon an Elder-tree in _Goodman’s Fields_, which likewise changed to
_Chrysalis_ in the Ground in _July_; and the _Moths_ were also bred
in _October_: From whence I conclude that to be the Time when the Fly
is usually bred.

The UNICORN, or BINDWEED-HAWK MOTH. Mr. _Rosel_ reports this
_Caterpillar_ to feed in Corn-fields, on the Green-leaves of the
Corn. At the End of _July_ it was full fed, and went into the Earth
in order to change to its _Chrysalis_ State; and the _Moth_ was bred
in _June_ following. _Merian_’s Account of this Fly is, That the
_Caterpillar_ feeds on the Roots of the _Lesser Purple-Bindweed_,
which grows amongst Corn; that it went into the Ground, and changed
to a _Chrysalis_ at the End of _July_, and that the _Moth_ was bred
in _September_.

I have not yet had the good Fortune to meet with this _Caterpillar_,
but have seen several of the _Moths_ that have been bred and taken in
_England_. The Dung of this _Caterpillar_ is of a very extraordinary
Size and Figure; as well as some others that are expressed in the
Plates.

The PRIVET-HAWK MOTH. The _Caterpillars_ feed on _Privet_, _Lilac_,
_Holly_, _&c._ and are to be found in Nurseries and Gardens. Look on
the Ground under such Trees; and if you discover any of their Dung,
that will direct you to the _Caterpillars_ on the Trees above. They
go into the Ground, and change to the _Chrysalis_ State in _August_
and the _Moth_ appears in _June_ following. ’Tis not very common to
take the _Moth_ in the Fly-state.

The OLIVE-SHADES, or LIME-HAWK MOTH. This _Caterpillar_ is to be got
by beating the Boughs of the _Lime_ and _Elm_ Trees, in the Month of
_August_; at which Time it goes into the Earth, and there changes to
a _Chrysalis_, and the _Moth_ is bred in _May_. By looking carefully
about the Bodies of _Lime_ and _Elm_ Trees, in _May_, these and other
_Moths_ may be found: For, if the Flies are bred in the Morning, or
any Part of the Day, they never offer to fly till Night. You may
likewise get these _Moths_, and many other Sorts, in the _Chrysalis_
State, by digging with a Trowel about the Roots of the Trees the
_Caterpillars_ feed on; and the best Time to dig for the Hawk Kind is
the Month of _April_. This Fly is seldom taken on the Wing.

The EYED WILLOW-HAWK MOTH. The _Caterpillars_ are to be found on
the Willows that grow about the _Chelsea_ Water-works, and in most
such like Places. At the End of _August_, I have also found them
in Gardens feeding on the Leaves of Apple-trees. They put on the
_Chrysalis_ Form within the Earth in _September_, and the _Moths_
are produced in _May_. The _Chrysalis_ and _Moth_ may be got at the
same Time as directed for the Lime-Hawk.

The POPLAR HAWK MOTH. The _Caterpillar_ of this _Moth_ feeds on the
Leaves of the _Poplar_ Tree, as also on the _Willow_, and is to be
found at the same Times and Places as the _Willow-Hawk Caterpillar_.
It becomes a _Chrysalis_ in the Ground in _September_, and the _Moth_
appears in _May_. It is to be found in the _Chrysalis_ and Fly-state
as the before mentioned. All the Hawk-tribe fly very swiftly, and I
am inclined to believe feed in wet marshy Places, by reason I have
never taken them on the Wing in Places where I have always met with
Plenty of other Moths.

The LADIES BEDSTRAW, or ELEPHANT MOTH. The _Caterpillars_ are to
be found in the Ditches in _Rotherhith_ Marshes, and also by the
_New River_ Side, near _Hornsey_. They feed on the _White Ladies
Bedstraw_, and are full grown at the End of _July_; at which Time
they usually go into the _Chrysalis_ State, by making a light Spining
amongst their Food, where they remain till the End of the following
_May_: At which Time the _Moth_ is bred; but very seldom taken in
the Fly-state. Mr. _Albin_ has mentioned something very remarkable
of this _Caterpillar_, _viz._ its Dexterity in Swiming: For, feeding
commonly in or near the Water, if at any time it happens to fall in,
it turns itself on its Back, and swims, with its Head and Tail turned
together, till it gets hold on some Part of the Plant, by which it
helps itself up again. It lies in the Egg-state about nine Days.

The OZIER, or PEBBLE MOTH. Mr. _Dandridge_ found the _Caterpillar_
feeding on the _Dutch Willow_, in the Marshes near _Rotherhith_,

Leaves spun together; and at the Beginning of _August_ came forth the
_Moth_. This fly is very scarce.

The PUSS-MOTH. Though the _Caterpillar_ of this Fly seems most fond
of the _Willow_, it is often found on the _Abele_, or _Poplar_
Tree. It has a Power of stretching out, and putting back its Head,
at Pleasure; which it seems to do as it thinks itself more or less
in Danger. It is armed with two Tubes at the End of the Tail, and
two others within those, of a Blood red Colour, which it nimbly,
if touched by any Thing, darts out: The Use of these is (as I
apprehend) to prevent the _Ichneumon_ Flies from settling on them;
but, notwithstanding those Flies are often able to remain long
enough to leave their Eggs behind: In such Case, the _Moth_ is not
produced, but, instead thereof, the _Ichneumon_ pictured in the
Plate. Such _Caterpillars_ as the _Ichneumons_ have not fixed their
Eggs on, usually go into the _Chrysalis_ State at the Beginning of
_August_, on the Body of the Tree, and generally near the Ground, the
_Caterpillar_ gnawing the Wood into a Kind of Sawdust; which, mixing
with a glutenous Matter, or Cement, that comes from its Mouth, makes
a hard Case, in which the _Chrysalis_ is formed, on the outside of
the Tree; the _Moth_ appears the _May_ following. These _Moths_ are
seldom taken in the Fly-state; but may easily be obtained by breeding
the _Caterpillars_, which may be found at the same Time, and in the
same Places, where you take those that produce the _Willow_ and
_Poplar Hawks_.

_Figure_ 2. in the same Plate, represents a _Moth_ called the KITTEN.
The _Caterpillar_ feeds on _Black Thorn_, _Willow_, _&c._ becomes a
_Chrysalis_ at the Beginning of _August_, and the _Moth_ is bred in
_May_. The _Caterpillar_ and Fly are rarely to be met with.

The WILD ROSE-MOTH. The _Caterpillar_ feeds on the _Sweet Briar_
sometimes, but most commonly on the _Oak_; changes to a _Chrysalis_

_May_. The _Caterpillar_ and Fly are both scarce.

THE GOAT-MOTH. The most likely Means of obtaining the _Caterpillars_
is, to separate the Bark of some old _Willow_ from the Body of the
Tree by a Chissel. Thus probably you may discover some of them: Put
them into an earthen Jar, and feed them with _Willow_ Wood, which
Food they seem most fond of; but cover the Jar least they creep away.
Do not keep them in a Box, or any Thing made of Wood, least they eat
their Way through it and be lost. These _Caterpillars_ are full fed
about the Middle of _May_, at which Time they gnaw the Wood into a
Kind of Sawdust, which, being mixed with a glutenous Matter from
their Mouths, makes a Case wherein they change to the _Chrysalis_.
They lye in that State for about six Weeks; after which the _Moths_
appear, and may be found on the Bodies of _Willow_ Trees. This
_Chrysalis_, by the Help of strong, short Saw like Teeth round Part
of each Joint, and pointing towards the Tail, is enabled to force
its Fore Part through the Body of the Tree, (as is expressed in the
Plate), near which you’ll find the _Moth_, if you chance to look that
Day it is bred. They are reported to be three Years proceeding from
the Egg to the Fly; but this I have not myself experienced.

THE EMPEROR-MOTH. The best Way to be furnished with this fine _Moth_
is, to breed it from the _Caterpillar_, which may be found in its
infant State during the Month of _May_; but it is most adviseable
to seek for them before the 20th. The _Caterpillars_, when newly
hatch’d, are sociable, and keep together for about three Weeks,
after which Time they separate and are difficult to be found. The
most certain Food to take them on is the _Black Thorn_, and of that
such as is not of above two or three Years Growth. They are usually
found on Twigs about one or two Feet from the Ground, and (as I have
observed) herd in Clusters together, when they are in their first,
second and third Skins.—On the 12th of _May_ 1745, I had about sixty
_Caterpillars_ hatched from such Sort of Eggs as are expressed round
the _Black Thorn_ in the Plate: On the 19th they appeared in their
second Skin; on the 25th, in their third; on the 18th of _June_, in
their fourth, and, on the 22d, in their fifth. The _Caterpillars_
grew so much in this Skin in four Days, that they were three Times
as big as when full fed in their fourth Skin. On _June_ the 30th,
they shifted into their sixth and last Skin; in which Skin (as well
as in the former Skins) such as appear most Green are the female
_Caterpillars_. On the 12th of _July_ some of them began to spin
Cases, in order for their Change into the _Chrysalis_ State; and,
on the 26th, the whole threescore had spun themselves up. Thus they
remained throughout the Winter, and, from the 16th to the 30th of
_April_ following, I had forty of the _Moths_ bred; but the Rest of
the _Aurelias_ did not produce their _Moths_ till the Year following:
So that about twenty of my Number were in the _Chrysalis_ State
near two Years; and yet produced _Moths_ at last that were equally
beautiful and large. The Female lays from 250 to 300 Eggs, in such
Manner as is represented in the Plate, and these she hides in three
or four different Places for the more certain Security of some of
them.

The Case which contains the _Chrysalis_ is well worthy Notice, being
composed of a glutenous Matter fit to resist all Kinds of Weather;
and, for its greater Security, that Part which I call the Mouth is
doubly guarded: So that, if any Insect should chance to force the
first Fence, it will there meet with a second Resistance, and that
of so strong a Nature, from its particular make, that I am apt to
believe few, if any, can ever enter; and thus the _Chrysalis_ is
preserved in the most secure and wonderful Manner, as will be better
understood by attending to the Figure represented in the Plate. The
_Moth_ is very seldom taken in the Fly State.

and other Trees, as also against Walls, Houses, Barns, _&c._ If the
Weather proves very hot, the _Moth_ will fly in the Day-time. The
_Caterpillar_ is rarely found.

THE GREAT TYGER MOTH. The _Caterpillars_ are hatch’d from the Egg in
_August_, and feed in their infant State on _Nettles_, _Lettice_,
_&c._ till the End of _October_; when, if the Weather be cold and
bad, they find themselves a Residence for the Winter in Holes and
private Recesses, where they continue till the _March_ or _April_
following, as the Spring is more or less forward. At their coming
out of their Holes they feed on the young _Nettles_, _Chickweed_,
_&c._ that grows in dry Ditches and Gardens; and, when they are in
their last Skin, which is usually at the End of _May_, they may
easily be found in the Places already mentioned. At the Beginning of
_June_ they spin a Bag, and within that change to the _Chrysalis_,
in which State they lye for one Month, after which the _Moths_ come
abroad and are very common. I have observed, that most of the _hairy
Caterpillars_ live throughout the Winter, after the Manner above
mentioned.

Growths in dry Ditches, in Woods, _&c._ at the End of _April_.
It lives all Winter as the last mentioned, and changes to a
_Chrysalis_, within a Spinning, at the Beginning of _May_. The _Moth_
is bred about three Weeks after; flies in the Day-time, and is very
common.

from _Charlton-Church_, in _Kent_, down to the Road that leads to
_Woolwich_, there you will find them in Plenty. They make a Spinning
in _May_ amongst the dead Leaves on the Ground, and there change to
the _Chrysalis_. The _Moths_ come forth in _June_ and fly by Day.

the Leaves of the _Oak_, _Apple_ Trees, _&c._ A _Caterpillar_ brought
up by Mr. _Cabrier_ came to its full Growth near the Middle of
_June_; at which Time it fastened itself, in the Corner of the Box,
by a few small Threads: The 14th it changed to a _Chrysalis_, and the
_Moth_ appeared the 4th of _July_. The _Caterpillar_ was fed, in its
infant State, with _Lettice_, there being no _Oak_ Leaves at that
Time. This _Moth_ is to be found sticking on the Barks of the _Oak_
Trees in _Richmond_, _Bushey_, and other Parks, in _July_; but is not
common.

The GREAT ERMINE MOTH. Its _Caterpillar_ feeds on most Kinds of
Plants and Flowers; turns to a _Chrysalis_, within a Web on the
Ground, in _September_: The _Moth_ is bred in the _May_ following,
and may be found sticking on the Barks of Trees, on Pales, Walls,

The SPOTTED BUFF-MOTH. The _Caterpillars_ of this _Moth_ are very
mischievous in Gardens, feeding on most Kind of Herbage; but may
easily be shaken off the Plants and killed. They change to the
_Chrysalis_ within a Web on the Ground, and sometimes within the
Ground, in _September_, and the _Moths_ came out in _May_. Their
Eggs are of a light green Colour; and the _Caterpillars_, when first
hatch’d, which is about the Middle of _June_, are white and hairy.
The _Moth_ is frequently taken sticking on Houses, Walls, Pales, _&c._

The GIPSEY MOTH. The _Caterpillars_ are very destructive to all
Fruit-trees, on which they are found in Swarms envelop’d with a Web
like that of the Spider. In the Day-time they disperse themselves
over the whole Tree, but at Night come together again, and retire to
their Web. They put on the _Chrysalis_, form within a Spinning, at
the Beginning of _July_, and the _Moth_ is bred about fourteen Days
after. Their Eggs are covered with a yellowish Down, whereby they
are preserved from Cold throughout the Winter. This _Moth_ is very
common in _Germany_, and was produced from a Nest of Eggs that were
sent to Mr. _Peter Collinson_, who gave them to _Charles Lockyer_,
Esq; He bred _Moths_ from them as above mentioned; and, having turned
Numbers of them wild (as I have been informed) about _Ealing_ near
_Brentford_, in _Middlesex_, they are to be found there, but not any
where else that I have yet heard of.

The BUFF-TIP MOTH. The _Caterpillar_ feeds on the _Willow_ and
_Oak_, and may be easily found amongst the _Willows_ growing about
_Chelsea_, and in such like Places. They may be taken full fed
towards the End of _August_; at which Time Numbers of them go into
the Earth, and there Change to the _Chrysalis_, and the _Moths_
appear in the following _May_. It is not a very common Thing to take
this _Moth_ flying.

The WHITE-SATIN MOTH. Its _Caterpillar_ feeds on the _White Poplar_,
as also on _Willow_; changes to a _hairy Chrysalis_, within the
Leaves spun together, in _June_; lies in that State about twenty
Days, and then the _Moth_ flies abroad. You may take these Flies by
shaking the Boughs of the Trees they feed on. Their Eggs, when first
laid, are of a pale green Colour, which they cover with a Substance
looking like Leaf-silver. They continue about one Month in the
Egg-state, and the _Caterpillars_ live all Winter.

The LACKEY-MOTH. The _Caterpillars_ are very common, and feed on
most Kind of Herbage, especially _Black Thorn_, _White Thorn_, _&c._
about the Middle of _June_ they change to the _Chrysalis_ within a
Case, which they spin, and cover with a fine Dust of the Colour of
Brimstone. In this State they remain for about one Month; then the
_Moth_ appears, and lays her Eggs, in a spiral Order, round the young
Twigs of such Trees as are proper Food for the infant _Caterpillars_.
They hatch in the Spring, and keep together in a Web while young. As
these _Caterpillars_ are destructive in Gardens to Fruit-trees, _&c._
its adviseable to destroy them.

The GREAT EGGER-MOTH. The _Caterpillars_ of this _Moth_ are to be
found, full grown, towards the End of _May_, feeding on _Black Thorn_
and _White Thorn_. At the Beginning of _June_, they spin a brown
Case, in the Shape of an Egg, in which the _Chrysalis_ is formed:
They remain in that State for about one Month; then the _Moth_ is
produced. The Males fly swiftly in the Day-time, from 12 o’Clock to
5 in the Afternoon. The Eggs are of an oval Shape, and usually hatch
at the latter End of _July_. When the _Caterpillars_ are young, you
may feed them with _Black Thorn_, or _White Thorn_, and, during the
Winter, with _Bramble_, _Holly_, _Privet_, _&c._ When you breed any
female _Egger-Moths_, take one of them and put it in a Box (covered
with a Piece of Crape, to prevent its getting away), carry the Box
with you to the Sides of Woods and green Lanes; and, if the Day be
fair, and the Sun shines bright, put it upon the Ground: And, if
there is a Breed of these _Moths_ near, the Males will come and
endeavour to get at the Female. By this means I have taken with my
Net near twenty in an Hour. This Method of taking Flies is called
_Simbling_; and many other Kinds of _Moths_ are to be catched the
same Way.

The GRASS EGGER-MOTH. I took the _Caterpillars_ of this _Moth_
feeding on _Clover_ amongst _Grass_. They make a Spinning and Case,
on the Surface of the Earth, about the Middle of _June_, and therein
turn to a _Chrysalis_. The _Moth_ flies in the Middle of _August_;
but is not commonly met with.

The DECEMBER MOTH. Mr. _Dandridge_ took some of its _Caterpillars_,
at the Beginning of _June_, on the _Hasle_; but, observing they eat
but little, gave them fresh Boughs that were wet with Rain, on which
they fed greedily. The next Day he gave them Water and Honey mixt
together, of which they drank a good Quantity, and fell to eating
again very heartily. In this Manner he fed them every Day, and
sometimes twice a Day, till the Middle of the same Month, when they
went into the Earth and changed into _Chrysalis_. The _Moths_ came
out at the End of _December_. I took this Year (1748) two of these
_Caterpillars_ on the Leaves of an _Oak_, wherewith I fed them till
the Middle of _June_, when they spun a dirty coloured Case which
contained the _Chrysalis_; and the _Moths_ were bred on the 24th
_October_.

The SPOTTED RED and WHITE UNDERWING MOTH. I found and fed the
_Caterpillar_ on _Black Thorn_: It made a Spinning, and changed to
_Chrysalis_ in the Middle of _April_, and the _Moth_ came abroad
about the Middle of _May_. The _Caterpillar_ lives all Winter, and
the _Moth_ is rarely to be met with.

The WOOD TYGER MOTH. This _Moth_ I first discovered in _Cain Wood_.
The _Caterpillar_ lives all Winter, feeds on _Chickweed_, _Lettice_,
the _Lesser Plantain_, _&c._ and is full grown about the Middle of
_April_, when it changes to the _Chrysalis_ within a Spinning: The
_Moth_ is bred in the Middle of _May_, flies by Day, and may be taken
in _Cain_ or _Tottenham_ Woods; an Afternoon is the best Time.

The MOTHER of PEARL MOTH. _Nettles_ are the Food of the
_Caterpillar_, within the Leaves of which (folded together) it
lives, and feeds till the Beginning of _June_; when it puts on the
_Chrysalis_ Form wrapt up within a Leaf, whose Edges are fastened by
a Spinning: Fourteen Days after the _Moth_ appears, and may be taken,
very commonly, in an Evening, amongst _Nettles_.

The YELLOW JULY OAK-MOTH. The Food of the _Caterpillar_ is the Leaves
of the _Oak_ Tree, on which it feeds till the Middle of _June_; then
it changes to a _Chrysalis_ in some Chink or other that it meets
with in the Bark of the said Tree, over which Chink or Hole the
_Caterpillar_ spins a strong Web, which prevents any Bird or Insect
from getting at it in its _Chrysalis_ State. The _Moth_ is bred in
the Middle of _July_, and may, now and then, be found on the Barks of
the _Oak_ Trees in _Richmond_ and other Parks, about that Time; but
it is not a common Fly.

The SMALL EGGER-MOTH. _Black_ and _White Thorn_ are the Food of the
_Caterpillars_, which are always found in Colonies; the whole Nest of
them feeding together till they are ready to change. When they are
first hatch’d from the Egg, they spin a Web to shelter themselves
from the Weather; and, as they grow, enlarge it with several
Divisions. They seldom go from the Plant they are first hatched on,
till they have eaten it quite bare and want Food. They ordinarily
spin a Thread from their main Web to guide them Home again; this is
very particular, and seems necessary to them. About the Beginning of
_July_ you may find them full fed; then they spin a Web, within which
a Case is formed, shaped like an Egg, which contains the _Chrysalis_:
In this State they remain all Winter, and the _Moths_ are bred in
_March_. It is adviseable, if you feed the _Caterpillars_, to take
the whole Nest with the Web. I have seldom taken the _Moths_.

The FOX COLOURED MOTH. The _Caterpillar_ is hatch’d in _July_, lives
all Winter, and feeds on _Grass_, _Brambles_, _&c._ I have seen them
in _September_ as large as they are in the Middle of _April_, which
is the Time they go to _Chrysalis_, within a Spinning or Web. The
_Moth_ is bred in the Middle of _May_, and the Cock flies swiftly in
an Afternoon; but may be taken in a Net, by the Sides of Woods and
green Lanes.

The CINNABAR-MOTH. The _Caterpillars_ of this Fly are sociable and
feed together in Numbers on the _Ragwort_; in _July_ they are full
grown, and then some go into the Earth, and others spin on the
Surface of the Ground, in order to their Change into the _Chrysalis_
State. The _Moths_ are produced in the _May_ following, and are
common in Fields and Gardens.

mixing its Hairs with the Bag it spins: The _Moth_ comes forth the

The LAPPIT-MOTH. The Eggs of this _Moth_ are laid about the Middle
of _July_, and remain in that State fourteen Days. I fed the
_Caterpillars_, when first hatch’d, with _Black Thorn_, and continued
giving them the same Food till _October_; at which Time they were in
their fourth Skin, and appeared as represented at Letter _a_; They
there stretched themselves at full Length on the Twigs, and remained
so till the _April_ following, without eating any thing that I could
perceive, notwithstanding at different Times I put in fresh green
Food to try them. About the End of _May_ the _Caterpillars_ are full
grown, in which Condition _b_ represents the Female; they then make a
Spinning, within which the _Chrysalis_ is formed, and remains in that
State for one Month, when the _Moth_ is bred; though it is rarely
met with in the Fly-state. The _Caterpillars_ are to be found, at
the End of _May_, sticking close to the Boughs of the _Black Thorn_,
_Bramble_, _&c._ You must look for them about a Foot or two from the
Ground; but, as their Colour nearly resembles the Bark of their Food,
it is very difficult to see them.

at the End of _May_ (within such a Case as is expressed in the Plate)
at which Time they are easily found upon the Grass, by the Sides of
Fields and Hedges. The _Moths_ are bred at the End of _June_, and may
be taken flying in an Evening, in green Lanes and by the Sides of
Woods.

The YELLOW-TAIL MOTH. The _Caterpillar_ feeds on _Elder_, _Oak_,
_Black Thorn_, _&c._ upon all which Growths you may find them at the
End of _May_. It changes to a _Chrysalis_, within a Spinning, at the
Beginning of _June_, and the _Moth_ comes forth at the End of the
same Month. They may be found sticking against the Barks of the Trees
in Parks, and other Places, and also flying in the Evening. They
lay Eggs of a pale Colour, and cover them with a woolly Substance.
The _Caterpillars_ are hatch’d in _August_, and will feed on _Black
Thorn_ till the End of _October_; at which Time they spin themselves
little Cases, and remain in them till the Spring following.

Fruit-trees, and Shrubs; becomes a _Chrysalis_ within the Earth in
_October_, and in _May_ following the _Moth_ appears, and may be
found sticking against Pales, Walls, Trees, _&c._ Their Eggs are very
small, and of a fine green Colour, and the _Caterpillars_ are common
in Gardens and other Places. It is observed, that the Protuberance
on the Back of the _Caterpillar_ is of a fleshy Substance, with Hair
growing out of it.

The WILD PINE-TREE LAPPIT-MOTH. Mr. _Rosel_ informs us, That the
_Caterpillars_ of this curious Fly feed on the _Pinus sylvestris_,
or WILD PINE: That they are full fed in the Month of _June_, at
which Time they change to _Chrysalis_, within such a Spinning as is
represented in the Plate; and, after lying in that State three Weeks
the _Moths_ appear.

About the Middle of _September_, 1748, I took one of these
_Caterpillars_ upon a _White Thorn_ Bush, near _Richmond_ Park; which
is still alive this 20th Day of _January_ 1748-9, though it has eat
nothing, that I know of, since it has been in my Custody. It remains
stretched out, in the Manner of the _Lappit-Caterpillar_ represented
at the Letter _a_ of the first Plate of this Section; and I do not
think it will begin to feed until there are Buds of _Black_ or _White
Thorn_ to give it. This is the only _Caterpillar_ of the Kind that
I have known taken in _England_.—For the Drawings exhibited in my
Plate, I am obliged to Mr. _Rosel_.

The BLACK TUSSOCK-MOTH. This _Moth_ is bred about the Middle of
_June_; at which Time it lays Eggs of a light grey Colour, inclosed
within a woolly Substance; and thus they continue for about one
Month. When the infant _Caterpillars_ appear, they feed on _Black
Thorn_, _White Thorn_, _Bramble_, _&c._ They live all the Winter in
the _Caterpillar_ State, and change to a _hairy Chrysalis_, within a
Spinning, about the Middle of _May_. The _Caterpillars_ may be found,
full fed, on _Black Thorn_ that grows by the Sides of Woods and
Hedges; as for the _Moth_, it is not commonly taken in the Fly-state.

The YELLOW TUSSOCK-MOTH. Its _Caterpillar_ feeds on the _Red
Archangel_, _Oak_, _Hasle_, _&c._ towards the End of _September_. It
makes a Spinning, within which a _hairy Chrysalis_ is formed, where
it lives till the Middle of _May_ following, and then the _Moth_
takes its flight; but it is not a very common Fly.

The RED-SPOT TUSSOCK-MOTH. The _Caterpillars_ are very common,
feeding on most _Elm_ and _Lime_ Trees about Town. They make a
Spinning under the Copings of Walls, Pales, _&c._ at the End of
_May_; and the _Moth_ is bred at the End of _June_ and in _July_. The
Females have no Wings; but, if you carry one or two of them in a Box
(where there is a Breed of this _Moth_) the Males will follow you in
order to get at them: So that, if you put the Box on the Ground, you
may easily take the Cocks with your Net. Several other _Moths_ may be
taken by the like Means.

The ORANGE TUSSOCK-MOTH. The Food of its _Caterpillar_ is _Hasle_,
_St. John’s Wort_, _Oak_, _&c._ About the Middle of _May_ it made a
Spinning, and changed to a _Chrysalis_, and the _Moth_ came forth
three Weeks after. It is very scarce, and the Female has no Wings.
I took one of these _Caterpillars_, feeding on _Oak_ Leaves, on the
25th of _September_ 1748; two Days after, it spun up in order to its
_Chrysalis_ State, and, on the 8th of _October_, the _Moth_ was bred:
From whence I conclude, this _Moth_ breeds twice in a Year.

THE SYCAMORE TUSSOCK-MOTH. You may find the _Caterpillars_ on
_Sycamore_ Trees, and, towards the End of _August_, they are usually
full fed; at which Time they spin themselves up, intermixing their
Hairs with the Web, and change into the _Chrysalis_ State. The
_Moths_ are bred in _May_ and _June_, are not uncommon, and may be
found on the Bodies of the Trees in _St. James’s Park_, on Pales,
Walls, _&c_.

on _Oak-leaves_, and becomes a _Chrysalis_, within some of the same
Leaves spun together, at the Beginning of _June_. The _Moth_ appears
at the Beginning of _July_, and is extremely scarce, as is also the
_Caterpillar_.

The SILVER _Y_ MOTH. The _Caterpillar_ feeds on _Sage_, _Clover_,
_Burdock_, _&c._ changes to a _Chrysalis_, within a slight Spinning,
in _August_, and the _Moth_ is bred in _September_; is very common in
most Fields and Gardens, and flies in the Day as well as at Night.
There is an early Breed of this _Moth_ in _May_.

The _Caterpillars_ of this Chapter have two Feet and two Holders,
with six Hooks or Claws; but have no Feet in the Middle Part of their
Bodies like those already described. Their progressive Motion is
performed by fixing the Head-part, and drawing up the Tail to it;
so that each Step, forming a Loop, they are called LOOPERS. They
are provided with strong and sharp Claws in their Holders, by which
they can fasten themselves in such manner as to support the Rest of
their Bodies, either perpendicularly or horizontally, or in any other
Posture they please, without any regard to the Center of Gravity in
their respective Bodies. They are able likewise, out of their own
_Viscera_ or Bowels, to furnish themselves with Lines, whereby they
can let themselves down from the Branches of Trees, or other Heights,
as they find Occasion.

in the Top-leaves of which (spun together) it lies concealed in the
Day-time. Some Leaves, thus spun together, looked as if they had been
dead; but, on Examination, _Caterpillars_ of this Sort were found
therein: They changed to a _Chrysalis_, spun amongst the Leaves, at
the End of _May_. The _Moth_ is bred at the Beginning of _July_, and
may be taken, in the Evening, by the Sides of Woods, Hedges, _&c._

Earth, and turns to a _Chrysalis_ in _August_: The _Moth_ appears in
_May_, and is then to be found sometimes, sticking on the Barks of
the above Trees; but it is not common.

the _Chrysalis_ State, within the Earth, about that Time, and the
_Moth_ is bred in _October_, when it may be found sticking on the
Bark of Trees, in Parks and other Places.

Time several of them changed to the _Chrysalis_ betwixt the Leaves
spun together. They remained in that State during the Winter, and the
_Moths_ were bred in _May_ following. This _Moth_ is to be taken, in

to the _Chrysalis_ amongst the _Pear_ Leaves: They continue fourteen
Days in that State, and the _Moth_ appears about the End of _June_.

The HAWTHORN MOTH. The _Caterpillars_ that produce this Kind of
_Moth_ are of various Colours, some being much lighter than others.
I got several of them by beating the Boughs of the _White Thorn_,
about the Middle of _September_; at which Time many of this Sort spin
themselves amongst the Leaves and change to _Chrysalis_, and the
_Moths_ are bred in the Middle of _May_ following. This is a very
scarce Fly.

The ORANGE MOTH. The four different coloured Flies represented in
the Plate, were all produced from _Caterpillars_ that were hatched
from the Eggs of such a Female as is represented at _Fig._ 1. The
Eggs were of a pale green Colour, and were hatch’d on the 13th
_July_ 1747; and the young _Caterpillars_ were fed with the Leaves
of _Black-Thorn_, till about the 20th, when they changed their first
Skin; on the second of _August_ they changed their Skin again, and,
about the Middle of the same Month, they left off eating: But,
_October_ the 25th, being put on _Bramble_ Leaves, they began to eat
again, and changed their Skin a third Time, _November_ the 28th;
after which they remained pretty quiet the whole Winter without
eating. At the End of _March_ they began to eat the fresh Buds of
the _Black_ and _White-Thorn_, and changed their Skin for the fourth
Time. About the End of _April_, one that was separated from the Rest
changed its Skin a fifth Time _May_ the 10th: spun up _May_ the 29th:
and the _Moth_ was produced _June_ the 17th. Several others spun
up between _May_ the 22d and _June_ the 5th, and the _Moths_ were
produced between _June_ the 12th and 25th. One that did not change
its Skin, for the last Time, till _June_ the 26th, was given to the
Proprietor of this Work; it spun up in the Leaves, on the 10th of
_July_, and the _Moth_, _Fig._ 2. was bred on the 1st of _August_.
Of eight _Moths_ that were produced, three were Females of the
common Orange Kind, and five were Males, one of which only was all
over of an Orange Colour. Amongst the _Caterpillars_ there was one
that changed its fourth Skin, _July_ the 4th, and fed for some Time;
however, it has not yet changed its fifth Skin, tho’ it continued
alive, without eating, till _December_ the 25th 1748, at which Time
it was put on _Bramble_ Leaves, and has continued to feed thereon
till the present 3d of _February_ 1748-9.——The Author of this Work
was favoured with the preceeding Account by a most skilful and exact
observer, whose Name, had he leave to mention it, would do him great
Honour.

The LARGE MAGPYE, or CURRAN MOTH. Most Gardens and Hedges abound
with the _Caterpillars_ of this Fly, which feed on _Curran_ and
_Gooseberry-Bushes_, and also on the _Black Thorn_, _&c._ They change
into the _Chrysalis State_, hanging by the Tail, at the End of _May_,
and the _Moths_ appear in the Middle of _June_. They are very common,
and easily taken in an Evening in the Gardens, and most other Places,
and may likewise be catch’d in the Day-time, by beating the Hedges
and Bushes. The _Caterpillar_ lives all Winter, and in the Spring
begins to feed as soon as the Buds are open.

The GOOSEBERRY-MOTH. The _Caterpillars_ are hatch’d at the latter End
of the Year, and live all Winter. About the Middle of _May_ you may
find Plenty of them on the _Gooseberry_ and _Curran_ Bushes; about
which Time they go into the Ground, and turn to _Chrysalis_, and
about the Middle of _June_ the _Moths_ appear. They are common in
most Gardens in the Evening, and may be taken in the Day-time, as the
last.

The BRINDLE-MOTH. This _Caterpillar_, which is not common among the
Loopers, was found by Mr. _Dandridge_ on the _Hasle_, at the Beginning
of _June_. It also feeds on _Oak_, _&c_. On the 14th of the same
Month it went into the Ground and changed into a _Chrysalis_, and at
the Beginning of _April_ following the _Moth_ came out. The Females
have no Wings. I have had several of this Kind of _Moth_ bred in
_February_ from the _Chrysalis_, which I got by digging with a Trowel
at the Root of Oak Trees. The _Moth_ is rarely taken in the Fly-state.

it chang’d to a _Chrysalis_, by fastening the Oak-Leaf close to the
Bottom of the Box I kept it in with a Spinning. Thus it remained
through the Winter, and the _Moth_ was bred at the End of _May_. Both
_Caterpillar_ and _Fly_ are very rare.

I have yet heard was ever taken in _England_ or elsewhere. It was
found about the Middle of _April_, 1741, flying in a Wood, in the
Day-time, near _Cookham_, by _Westram_, in _Kent_. It was taken by
Mr. _William Constable_, who lives near that Place; and the _Moth_ is
at present in the Collection of Mr. _Charles Cabrier_, of _London_.

The SWALLOW-TAIL BUTTERFLY is produced twice a Year. The first Brood
appears in _May_, the second towards the End of _July_. Being in a
Meadow near _Cookham_, in _Kent_, on the 5th Day of _August_, 1748, I
observed a Female _Swallow-Tail_ hovering over certain Plants, which
taking particular Notice of, I found to be the _Meadow Saxifrage_,
and examining them carefully, I discovered four Eggs just laid by
the _Fly_, wherewith I was highly pleased. On the 13th of the same
Month these Eggs produced _Caterpillars_, of Size and Colour as
expressed at Figure 1. On the 19th one of the _Caterpillars_ shifted
its Skin, and appeared like Figure 2. On the 23d it changed again to
the Likeness of Figure 3. On the 4th of _September_ it became like
Figure 4. On the 11th of the same Month it appeared in its fifth and
last Skin, which was extreamly beautiful, as expressed at Figure 5.
On the 22d the _Caterpillar_ was full grown, and fixed itself in the
Manner of Figure 6, in order to change into the _Chrysalis_ 7, which
was produced on the 26th of _September_; in which State it remains,
_January_ 20, 1748-9. I fed the _Caterpillar_ from its being first
hatched with the green Leaves of the common Carrot, which it eat
plentifully. This fine _Butterfly_ may be taken in the Meadows and
Clover Fields about _Cookham_, near _Westram_, in _Kent_, at the
Times above-mentioned. It flies so swiftly that it is in vain to
follow it, you must therefore wait ’till it settles, and then, if you
are near, be nimble, and you may catch it without much Difficulty.
The _Flies_ are represented in the next Plate numbered the same as
this.

The BRIMSTONE-BUTTERFLY lives in the _Fly_ State all the Winter
Season, for very early in the Spring you will see them in the
Woods flying about and seeking out their Mates. The Food of the
_Caterpillar_ is reported by Mr. _Dandridge_ to be the _Buck-Thorn_,
on which he fed it ’till the Middle of _June_, when it changed to a
_Chrysalis_, and the _Fly_ was bred at the Beginning of _August_.
The _Caterpillars_ are rare to be met with, although the _Fly_ is
common in Woods and Fields of Clover, in the Months of _August_ and
_September_.

The LARGE WHITE GARDEN-BUTTERFLY breeds twice a Year. The
_Caterpillars_ thereof are well known in Gardens and other Places.
Their first Brood is in _May_, and the second about two Months after.
The _Chrysalis_ that produces the second Brood is only fourteen Days
in that State, and the _Fly_ is bred in _July_. Those _Caterpillars_
that go to _Chrysalis_ about _September_ remain in that State all
the Winter, and produce their _Flies_ in _May_. These _Caterpillars_
are great Devourers of _Cabbage_ and _Colliflowers_ from _June_ to
_September_, which last Month is the Time of their changing into the
_Chrysalis_ State. In order to preserve your Cabbages, _&c._ ’tis
worth while to destroy their _Chrysalides_ in the Winter, when they
may commonly be found under the Coping of Garden Walls, Pales, or
any other Places a little shelter’d: Their Eggs likewise should be
sought after, and may be found in great Numbers together on the
under Sides of the Leaves. _Note_, The _Swallow-Tail Butterfly_ is
always bred at the same Time as this _Fly_ is.

The SMALL WHITE GARDEN-BUTTERFLY breeds twice a Year: The first
Brood is at the Beginning of _May_, and the second in _July_. The
_Caterpillar_ feeds on _Cabbage_, _Horse-Radish_, _Cresses_, _&c._
Towards the End of _June_ they tie themselves up by the Tail with a
Thread, which goes likewise cross their Middle. The _Fly_ comes forth
in _July_, and is very common.

THE ORANGE-TIP, or LADY OF THE WOODS, A BUTTERFLY. We are obliged to
Mr. _Rosel_ for the Discovery of the Progress of this and many other
curious _Flies_. He says the _Caterpillar_ feeds on the _Brassica
Sylvestris_, or _Wild Cole_, whereon the _Fly_ lays its Eggs. The
_Caterpillar_ is found in _June_ and _July_, at which Time it changes
into a _Chrysalis_. It remains in that State through the Winter, and
the _Fly_ is produced in _May_. It is very common in Fields and green
Lanes, and breeds but once a Year.

The MARMORIS, or MARBLE BUTTERFLY. On the 8th of _July_, 1748. I took
with my Net several Females of this sort of _Fly_, which is very
common amongst the _Hay-Grass_. I put them in a Box, taking Care to
hurt them as little as possible, with full Hopes that some of them
would lay their Eggs; and according to my Wishes the next Morning I
had 160 Eggs, which, when first laid, were of a fine yellow Colour,
but in less than a Minute’s Time they became perfectly white, and
are not glutinous like many other Sorts. On the 27th and 28th of the
same Month the young _Caterpillars_ appeared, and were put on common
Grass to feed: They continued extremely small for some Months, and,
notwithstanding great Care was taken of them, only three _Flies_ were
produced, the rest all dying in the _Caterpillar_ State.

The different Changes observed in these three were as follows.

           Caterpillars changed          Went to    The _Flies_
               their Skins.            _Chrysalis_.  were bred.

    {_3d  May_,    1 _May_ 21 _June_ 9 | _July_  4 | _July_ 27}

The _Caterpillars_ that produced these _Flies_ changed to _Chrysalis_
on the Ground, without fastening themselves to any Thing, and were
fed all the Time with common Grass, and it is presumed changed their
Skins twice before the 11th of _April_.

The MEADOW BROWN-BUTTERFLY. The _Caterpillar_ was found by Mr.

of _May_, when it fastened itself up by the Tail, and changed into a
short thick green _Chrysalis_ streaked with black, and on the 11th
of _June_ came out the _Butterfly_, which is one of the most common
sorts the Fields afford, and yet the _Caterpillar_ is rarely found.

The GREAT ARGUS-BUTTERFLY breeds twice a Year: The first Time is
in _May_, the second in _July_. _Merian_ says, the _Caterpillar_
feeds on _Grass_, and that it changes to a small green _Chrysalis_,
from which proceeds this elegant _Fly_, adorned with brown and
black Spots, having two white Horns spotted with black, and Eyes
of a beautiful Colour. This _Butterfly_ is very common; its Flight
is not swift: It delights to settle on dry Banks and Walls, and in
Path-Ways, and is not difficult to take. Its _Caterpillar_ is seldom
found.

that it changed to a _Chrysalis_ on the 19th of _June_, and that ten
Days after the _Fly_ was bred.

The GRIZZLED BUTTERFLY. Mr. _Rosel_ tells us, that the _Caterpillar_
of this _Fly_ was found on the _Mallow_, with the Leaves of which he
fed it till the End of _June_, when it spun a Web amongst the Leaves,
and changed to a _Chrysalis_, the _Butterfly_ of which was bred the
_May_ following. This _Fly_ is to be taken in Woods and Meads, at the
Beginning of _May_: and although small, it flies swiftly, so that you
must be very quick to take it.

The ADMIRABLE BUTTERFLY. The great _Stinging Nettle_ is the Food
of this _Caterpillar_, which is to be found by observing where
the _Nettle-Leaves_ appear to be folded or spun together, for
within such Leaves the _Caterpillar_ feeds. It turns in _August_
to a _Chrysalis_, hanging perpendicularly downwards by the Tail,
fourteen Days after the _Chrysalis_ is formed the _Fly_ appears. The
_Caterpillars_ shelter themselves after this Manner, that they may
be the better secured from the too great Heat of the Sun, from Rain,
Birds, and a small _Ichneumon Fly_, which often hinders their coming
to Perfection, by laying its Eggs therein, which Eggs are of such
a glutenous Nature, that they stick fast as soon as laid. Some of
the _Chrysalides_ appear as if gilded with burnished Gold, but such
usually produce not a _Butterfly_, but a Brood of small, though very
beautiful _Ichneumons_. The _Fly_ may be taken in Gardens and other
Places, it feeds on _Fruit_ that lies under Trees, _&c._ and is no
uncommon _Fly_. It lives quite through the Winter.

The PEACOCK-BUTTERFLY. You must look for the _Caterpillar_ that
produces this _Fly_ in the great _Stinging-Nettle_. They are sociable
and feed together, are very easy to find, and may be taken full fed
towards the End of _June_, at which Time many of them change to the
_Chrysalis_, and about fourteen Days after the _Fly_ appears. It is
very common, and may be taken on _Thistles_, _Burdock_, _Clover_, &c.
The _Chrysalis_ of this _Fly_, as well as the preceding, sometimes
looks as if gilt with Gold: but such fine outsides usually produce
_Ichneumons_. This _Fly_ likewise lives all the Winter.

The PAINTED-LADY-BUTTERFLY. In this Plate two _Butterflies_ are
represented, the upper one of which is the _Painted Lady_. Its
_Caterpillar_ feeds on the great _Stinging-Nettle_, _Thistles_, _&c._
changes to a _Chrysalis_ within the Leaves folded together in the
Middle of _June_, is fourteen Days in that State, and then the _Fly_
comes forth. It may be taken on the same Growths as the last, but is
not so common.

Figure 4 represents, the SMALL TORTOISE-SHELL-BUTTERFLY, which is
very common, and breeds twice a Year: The first Brood is towards
the End of _June_, the second about the End of _August_. The
_Caterpillar_ feeds on _Nettles_, is open and sociable, and may
be taken full fed about the Middle of _June_, and the Middle of
_August_, and is about fourteen Days in _Chrysalis_. This _Butterfly_
out-lives the Winter.

The GREAT TORTOISE-SHELL-BUTTERFLY. When the _Caterpillars_ of this
_Fly_ are young, they feed together on the Leaves of the _Elm-Tree_,
_&c._ About the Middle of _June_ they are full fed, and usually
tie themselves up by the Tail under the Copings of Walls, or some
such Shelter; in the Beginning of _July_ the _Fly_ comes out, and
delights to settle in dry Path-ways, as also on the Bodies of Trees,
_&c._ is swift in its Flight, and requires Nimbleness to take it. The
_Chrysalis_ is very apt to produce _Ichneumons_ instead of its own
_Butterfly_, those Creatures having laid their Eggs therein. This
_Fly_ lives all Winter.

The COMMA-BUTTERFLY breeds twice a Year: The first Time towards the
End of _June_, and the second about the Beginning of _September_.
The _Caterpillar_ feeds on _Hop-Leaves_, _Nettles_, _&c._ puts on
the _Chrysalis_ Form in _June_ and _August_, and is about fourteen
Days in that State, when the _Fly_ appears, which may be taken in
Gardens, on _Blackberry_ Blossoms, by the Sides of Hedges, and in
such like Places. The Colours of the first Brood of this _Butterfly_
are considerably lighter than as here represented.

The GREAT FRITILLARY-BUTTERFLY. Mr. _Rosel_ says, the _Caterpillar_
feeds on _Nettles_, in the private Recesses of Woods, that it changes
into the _Chrysalis_ State at the End of _May_, and that the _Fly_
is produced in _June_. This _Butterfly_ is very swift in Flight,
and is best taken in the Forenoon, when it will settle and feed on
_Blackberry Blossoms_, _Thistles_, _&c._ They are most commonly found
in Woods, and the Fields adjacent to Woods.

The PLANTAIN FRITILLARY-BUTTERFLY. The _Caterpillar_ hereof feeds on
_Plantain_, _Clover_, and _Grass_, changes to a _Chrysalis_, within
a Web of its own spinning, upon the Surface of the Ground, at the
Beginning of _May_, and the _Fly_ appears fourteen Days after. The
_Caterpillars_ are sociable, and feed together. They appear of a
very timorous Nature, for if you move the Food on which they are,
they immediately quit their Hold and fall to the Ground, and there
remain in a curl’d up Form till such Time they think the Danger over.
The _Butterfly_ is swift in Flight, but may be taken if diligently
attended to, in Fields of _Hay-Grass_, at the Time above-mentioned.

The HEATH FRITILLARY-BUTTERFLY. I found the _Caterpillars_ of this
_Fly_ feeding on common _Heath_ in _Tottenham_-Wood, about the Middle
of _May_, 1745, and they are of the same fearful Nature as the
last-mentioned. Six or seven of them were feeding near each other, I
observed their Manner of eating, which was extremely quick, and when
they moved it was at a great Rate. I fed them with common _Heath_ for
three or four Days; at the End of which some of them changed into
_Chrysalis_, in which State they remained about fourteen Days, and
then the _Flies_ came forth. This _Butterfly_ is very common in most
Woods, but its _Caterpillar_ is very rarely found.

The WILLOW-BUTTERFLY. About the Middle of _August_, 1748, two of this
Species of _Butterfly_ were taken near _Camberwell_, in _Surry_:
But in all my Practice I have never seen any of them in the Fields;
so that they were look’d upon as very great Rarities. They are very
common in _Germany_, and Mr. _Rosel_ tells us, the _Caterpillar_
feeds on _Willow_, and may be found all the Summer. The _Caterpillar_
and _Chrysalis_, in the Plate, are taken from a Draught by Mr.
_Rosel_.

The SMALL FRITILLARY-BUTTERFLY. About
the 10th of _April_, 1741, I took upon the Ground upwards of one
Hundred of these _Caterpillars_, in _Cain_ Wood. I gave them to eat
a Variety of Growths (which I gathered on the Spot where I found
the _Caterpillars_) but they were so restless and uneasy under
Confinement, that they seemed in continual Motion, neither would
they eat any of the Food I gave them. On the 18th of _April_ ten of
the _Caterpillars_ fastened themselves up by the Tail, in order to
their changing into the _Chrysalis_ State, (the rest being dead or
gone away) and on the 3d of _May_ following the _Flies_ were bred.
This _Butterfly_ is to be taken in Woods and Grass-Fields adjacent to
Woods, in the Month of _May_.

The GREAT FRITILLARY-BUTTERFLY,
with SILVER SPOTS. I take this _Fly_ to be of the Class under
Consideration. On the 15th of _July_, 1748, I had three Eggs laid by
such a _Fly_ as is represented in the Plate at Fig. 1, and on the
5th of _August_ the young _Caterpillars_ came forth; which, being
examined with a Microscope, appeared to be of the Size represented.
They were of a Flesh Colour, with Rows of Black Spots on each Joint
like the _Caterpillars_ of the _Emperor Moth_, and out of each Spot
grew Hairs of a sandy Colour. The Eggs were beautifully fluted down
the Sides, were flat at the Bottom, and had a glutenous Moisture upon
them, which occasioned their sticking fast wherever the _Fly_ chose
to leave them. The _Caterpillars_ on this present 10th of _February_,
1748-9, seem to be alive, but are very small, and, I believe, have
eat nothing all the Winter, though they have had Grass given them,
which I take to be their proper Food. The _Fly_ frequents Woods and
Meads, and loves to settle on _Blackberry Blossoms_, _Thistles_, &c.
At the Beginning of _July_ they may be taken with your Net; but as
no _Butterfly_ is more swift in Flight, you must attend till they
settle, then be nimble and you may catch them.

The PURPLE HAIR-STREAK-BUTTERFLY. The _Caterpillar_ feeds on
_Oak-Leaves_, becomes a _Chrysalis_ at the Beginning of _June_, and
in a Month after the _Fly_ appears. This _Butterfly_ is not so easily
taken as some others, for when it is not feeding it usually settles
high. I have taken the greatest Numbers early in a Morning, when I
have found them feeding on the Blossoms of the _Blackberry_.

The BROWN HAIR-STREAK-BUTTERFLY. The _Caterpillar_ of this
_Butterfly_ is seldom found: which, I believe, is owing to the
oddness of its Shape and Colour, which are exactly represented in
the Plate. I took four of them by beating the _Black-Thorn_, and
fed them on the same till the Middle of _June_, at which Time they
changed into the _Chrysalis_, and the _Fly_ was bred in the Middle of
_August_. This _Butterfly_ delights to settle on the _Maple-Tree_,
&c. by beating the Branches whereof the _Fly_ will rise, and may be
taken in your Net.

The GREEN BUTTERFLY. Mr. _Dandridge_ took the _Caterpillar_ of this
_Fly_ at the Beginning of _July_, feeding on the inside of the
_Blackberry_ Buds, in which it made a small Hole, whereby it entered,
and eating all the inward Part, left the Buds seemingly entire:
It fed on them till the Middle of _July_, and then changed to a
_Chrysalis_; and in the Middle of _April_, the Year following, the
_Fly_ was bred. This _Butterfly_ is most common in and near Woods;
it delights to settle on Boughs four or five Feet from the Ground,
by moving which the _Fly_ will rise, and if not much frighted will
settle on or near the same Place again, by which Means you may take
it with your Net. The best Time to catch this _Butterfly_ is from the
first to the fifteenth of _May_.

The BLUE ARGUS-BUTTERFLY breeds twice a Year: The first Brood appears
in _May_, the second at the End of _July_ and Beginning of _August_.
This _Fly_ is very common in most _Hay-Fields_ at those Times, and is
easily taken. As for the _Caterpillar_ and _Chrysalis_, I have never
yet heard that they have been discovered by any Body.

The PURPLE HIGH-FLYER, or EMPEROR OF THE WOODS. Neither the
_Caterpillar_ nor _Chrysalis_ of this charming _Fly_ has been yet
discovered, although sought after with the utmost Diligence for
several Years past. The _Butterfly_ appears at the End of _June_ and
Beginning of _July_, and may be taken in _Comb_-Wood in _Surry_,
about _Westram_ in _Kent_, and in other Places. It flies like a Hawk,
delighting to soar aloft and skim in the Air. When it settles it is
usually on some extreme Part of the _Oak_, _Hasle_, or _Ash-Tree_:
and what is very singular, I myself have seen twenty of them taken on
the same Branch one after another, for although the _Fly_ seems to
be extremely wild whilst on the Wing, yet, when settled, you may lay
your Net over it with little Trouble.
